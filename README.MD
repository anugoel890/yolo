# Automatic license plate detection (Object detection) using YOLO and Pytorch

In this example, we use YOLO and Pytorch to design a model that performs object detection. When the images of the cars with license plates are passed through the generated model, it automatically detects the number plates of the cars and forms bounding boxes around the license plates showing the detection. 

We have taken the dataset from Kaggle which consists of car images with number plates and their annotations in PASCAL VOC format. The steps to download the dataset are given in ipynb file. 

We use YOLOv5 for training of the model and performs validation and detection on the dataset. All the steps are given in ipynb file.
